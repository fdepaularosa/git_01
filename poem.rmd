In morning light, we rise and strive,   
With hearts ablaze, we feel alive.   
Two paths before us, skill and line,   
Each pushup counts, each moment fine.   

The strength within, a silent call,   
As muscles ache, we stand up tall.   
From ground to sky, we lift our will,    
Defying limits, climbing still.     

In rhythmâ€™s flow, our spirits soar,     
With every rep, we yearn for more.    
A test of grit, a dance of grace,    
Together, we embrace this space.    

So here we stand, in unity,    
In strength and sweat, we find our key.   
With every push, we shape our fate,    
In skill or line, we elevate.
