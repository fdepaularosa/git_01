## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

Twinkle, Twinkle Little Bat.  
How I wonder what you're at!   
Up above the world you fly,   
Like a tea tray in the sky.   
Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!  
How I wonder what you're at!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,  
And sorry I could not travel both.  
And be one traveler, long I stood.  
And looked down one as far as I could.   
To where it bent in the undergrowth;    

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

"The sun was shining on the sea,   
      Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make.   
      The billows smooth and bright —   
And this was odd, because it was.   
      The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,     
      Because she thought the sun.   
Had got no business to be there.    
      After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,   
      "To come and spoil the fun."   

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->

In morning light, we rise and strive,   
With hearts ablaze, we feel alive.   
Two paths before us, skill and line,   
Each pushup counts, each moment fine.   

The strength within, a silent call,   
As muscles ache, we stand up tall.   
From ground to sky, we lift our will,    
Defying limits, climbing still.     

In rhythm’s flow, our spirits soar,     
With every rep, we yearn for more.    
A test of grit, a dance of grace,    
Together, we embrace this space.    

So here we stand, in unity,    
In strength and sweat, we find our key.   
With every push, we shape our fate,    
In skill or line, we elevate.
